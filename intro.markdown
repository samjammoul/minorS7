# Introduction

This website will show all the tasks and activities that I will do
during the minor. By every task, will be a theory explanation about the
subject and a proof of concept that I did in order to practice that
task. 

The following link is the link to my board of tasks in Notion. I will
use that board to manage all the tasks of this minor and to make a clear
overview of the tasks and tasks status. The link to the board is public,
so everyone could view the content and add comments. \[1\]
