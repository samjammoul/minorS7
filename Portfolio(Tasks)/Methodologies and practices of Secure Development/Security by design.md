# 1 Security by design

After searching on the internet for a long time to figure out the
security by design principles, I came out with some methodologies that
be used by Microsoft (Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle). There
are many standards that are used to develop secure systems (ETSI TS 103
645, ISO/IEC 27000-series). 

I already reviewed the guide for the design of cyber-secure systems in
the National cyber security center (UK). The following five principles
are principles for the design of cyber-secure systems:  [[1]](#1)

**1. Establish the context before designing a system**

Before you can create a secure system design, you need to have a good
understanding of the fundamentals and take action to address any
identified shortcomings.

**2. Make compromise difficult**

Designing with security in mind means applying concepts and using
techniques which make it harder for attackers to compromise your data or
systems.

**3. Make disruption difficult**

When high-value or critical services rely on technology for delivery, it
becomes essential that the technology is always available. In these
cases, the acceptable percentage of 'down time' can be effectively zero.

**4. Make compromise detection easier**

Even if you take all available precautions, there's still a chance your
system will be compromised by a new or unknown attack. To give yourself
the best chance of spotting these attacks, you should be well positioned
to detect compromise.

**5. Reduce the impact of compromise**

Design to naturally minimize the severity of any compromise.

### Where will I use methodologies and practices of Secure Development?

I already made an overview of the methodologies and practices of Secure
Development. I will implement group projects with my collages, so I will
use the methodologies and practices of Secure Development during the
implementation of the Red/blue teaming project.
