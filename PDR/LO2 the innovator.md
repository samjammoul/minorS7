.DOT framework is applied to the research in order to ensure a reliable implementation. This framework ensures proper scientific research into the relevant fields. There is one main research question with three sub questions. 


## 2. Innovation and development skills
I worked on two research question in that research. The first question is `What are the existing blue team training sessions for inspiration?Â´ and the second is `How to compose a syllabus for entry level blue team trainees?`. 

For the first question, I used three different research method :
1. Library: Available product analysis, Community research
2. Workshop: Brainstorm
3. Field: Interview
This questions to find out the existing frameworks for blue team training and to use those frameworks for inspirations.

For the second research question, I worked on searching and finding the existing and used syllabus for the blue teaming, and I use the library method for this question.
## 3. Transfer of project results and research and innovation findings

### 3.1 Communication stakeholders
Besides preparing interview questions for the stakeholders, I am usually responsible for planning the interviews with stakeholder(s). For some points like discussing the concept of the game or the theme, I did some alone interview with the stakeholder(s) to discuss some points in the project, and I always inform my collage's about it.

During the research, I did also some interviews with a teacher of the semester 4 of cybersecurity to get feedback about the concept of the project and the theme of the game (end product).

Besides that, during the research also did an interview with 3 students of semester 4, to discuss with them the concept of the game and theme in order to improve the quality of the end product.

## 4. Conclusions
I did many activities during this semester that are related to the innovation phase. Working on the research, lets improving my professional skills. Like do many pitches and making interviews with stakeholders or the clients. I also I improved with working on documentations and working with group.
