Security Expert has two categories: Technical Security Expert and Non-technical Security Expert. These two categories are described below. A list with links to evidence from this portfolio is included.
I will graduate as a Software engineer and improve myself in security aspects, I have chosen Software security engineer as specialization. All the non-technical and technical task that I did in this minor is related to the software security engineer.

## 1. Technical Security Expert

## Reflection
I did all the interesting tasks, so I enjoyed this minor a lot. The plan that I did for the semester is perfect and super productive. Most of the knowledge is built during working on the portfolio and I applied it in my group project. If I evaluate myself, so I will give myself a good + because I learned a lot about building security software, and also during this semester, I learned many subjects that are related to software engineering.
