# Conclusions

I enjoyed this semester a lot, the subject that I choose is very interesting. This semester is full of motivation and enthusiasm, and working on the group project and on portfolio helped to improve my technical and non-technical and professional and innovations skills and archives my goals.

I will graduate in software engineering, but because of this minor, I had more opportunities to find the graduation project.

This semester I worked hard on my skills, and I tried my best to improve my skills. In the first of the sister worked very hard and then, I must be searching about the graduation project. Because of searching for a graduation project, I worked less on my portfolio and learning activities for a while, and then I found another plan that helped me to keep working on my learning activities and be more productive.
