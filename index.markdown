# Who am I?

I am Sam Jammoul and studying software engineering program and I want to
graduate as software engineer. I have a lot of interest in cyber
security, so I already did my 2 specializations in cyber. This semester,
I will do a Software Security engineer specialization. I would like to
get deeper into Software security. I will graduate as a software
engineer and would be nice to get deeper in software security and learn
about preventing vulnerabilities and get deeper in security measures
from the software engineer aspect.Â Next to my minor, I am doing English
courses to have a C1 level. After graduation, I have a plan to do a
master program in software engineering.
