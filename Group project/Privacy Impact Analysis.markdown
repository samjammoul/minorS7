# Privacy Impact Analysis

The following privacy impact analysis that I did for my project in semester 6 (Kwetter). My group project already did a privacy impact analysis. To practice the privacy impact analysis, I did it for an old project.

Kwetter is a social networking site. Kwetter is a Twitter clone with all of Twitter's basic features. There are three types of roles: management, moderation, and daily users. Users may post tweets, follow and be followed by others, add a profile picture, like another post, and mention each other on the platform. In the timeline, users could read the tweets of others and see the trending tweets.
