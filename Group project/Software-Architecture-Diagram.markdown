# Software Architecture Diagram
Together with my college Nicky, we set up a software architecture document. This document contains the context of the project and the problem that we will be solving, and also the goals of the project and the target users.

The document below contains the following diagrams :
1. A system Context (C1)
2. A Container diagram (C2)
3. A Component diagram (C3)
