# About the project
I discussed with Casper Schellekens about not having my own and using my group project to prove the tasks that I did in my portfolio. Casper Schellekens finds that using a group project is a good idea to practice the tasks of a software security engineer.

# Challenge
The client wants to teach fundamentals through an attractive training course in which time pressure also plays a role and the course should simulate real-world situations. 

# Goal

The client desires an usable game where they can educate trainees in blue and red teaming exercises. This platform needs to be able to facilitate new Cyber Security Trainees and help them understand the process of being in a blue or red team. It is important for the blue team to experience live incident response.

Blue:
1. Experience with monitoring software
2. Recognition of attack patterns
3. Prevention from new attacks from occurring
4. Performing under the pressure of time
5. Working together with multiple colleagues in a Security Operation Center

Red:
1. Performing a pentest
2. Experience with OWASP methodologies

# Results to be desired
The client needs a project that will facilitate blue and red team trainees to play a game in which the trainees can get real-life hands on experience in blue and red teaming. Raising the knowledge and experience of the trainees is the desired result.

In order to do this a dashboard will be raised for the blue team to monitor the Juice Shop application. The red team consists of automated scripts with attacks or the attacks need to be done manually. The blue team will have a security union environment which is setup to monitor the red teaming server / application. The actions will be done through a storyline that will look like a blue teaming capturing the flag event.
